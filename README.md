Skincare API

## Description

This project is a simple API that uses NLP to recommend skincare products based on the user's skin type and concerns. The API uses a pre-trained BERT model to classify the user's skin type and concerns and then uses a simple recommendation system to recommend products based on the user's skin type and concerns. The API is built using the FastAPI framework and the Hugging Face Transformers library.
